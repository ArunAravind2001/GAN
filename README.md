# GAN Project

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The project includes a generator and discriminator model for generating images from random noise.

## Overview

- **Generator**: Generates images from random noise vectors.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real or fake.

The GAN is trained using the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy
